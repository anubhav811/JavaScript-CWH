#### Javascript supports dynamic binding . Type of variables can be changed during runtime

- Difference between var and let
----------------------------------

1) var is globally scoped while let & const are block scoped
2) var can be updated and re-declared within its scope 
3) let can be updated but not re-declared.
4) const can be neither be updated nor be re-declared.
5) var variables are initialized with undefined whereas let and const are not initialized
6) const must be initialized during declaration unlike let and var
